    <title>Want to Learn</title>

<h3>Dear Sir/Madam,</h3>

I am writing to express my interest in android or backend part of Vedant Assets.
  </br> Currently, I am working as a Frontend Developer and possess strong coding skills in JavaScript. 
</br>However, I am eager to expand my skillset and gain experience in the backend or Android development domain.

</br>I understand the importance of having a comprehensive understanding of both frontend and backend technologies, and I am willing to put in the effort to upskill myself. 
</br>I am in the learning phase and am confident in my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and apply them effectively.

</br>I believe that my passion for learning, coupled with my ability to work collaboratively, would make me an asset to the Vedant Assets team. 
</br>I would be grateful for the opportunity to contribute my skills and experience to the company's success.

</br>  </br>You can see my portfolio <a href="https://abhishekmukherjeeportfolio.netlify.app/"> here</a>

</br>

</br>Sincerely,

</br>Abhishek Mukherjee
